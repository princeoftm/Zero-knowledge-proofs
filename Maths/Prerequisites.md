1.Without using a calculator, compute the remainder when $20212017^2$ is divided by $20212022$.?
Ans:
Using Fermats Theorem,We can say that the equation actually is 
```
(20212017**2)mod20212022
```

now we can say that it translates into 
```
(20212017mod20212022)*(20212017mod20212022)
```

now (20212017mod20212022)==5

so 
```5*5```

Sol:25

2.
a)What is the third-smallest positive value of x for which 2**x = 3(mod13)?
we know that 
```
(2**4)mod13==3
```
and 
```
(2**12) mod 13==1
```
the set is given by 
```
∈{ 4, 4+(1×𝑟), 4+(2×𝑟), 4+(3×𝑟),⋯}.
```
we know that r=12
```
∈{ 4, 4+(1×12), 4+(2×12), 4+(3×12),⋯}.

```
so our answer is 40

b)What is the fourth-smallest positive value of x for which 2**x=8(mod101)?
