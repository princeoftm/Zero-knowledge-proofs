Lets say we have an equation which is 

x*y +4 = 10

Our first constraint is 

output1==x*y

Our second constraint is 

output2 == output1 + 4

And our third constraint is 

Equality constraint i.e ==10


We can tell now that every equation has a left-input a right input and a output 

Such that 
left(L)*right(R)=Output(O)
With three vectors 
We get <L,v>*<R,v>=<O,v>
v is the variable vector
v=[1,x,y,output]
